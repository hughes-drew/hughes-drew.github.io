    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nMyeloSeq is a high-depth, tumor-only targeted sequencing panel designed to identify recurrent genetic variants in patients with myeloid neoplasms. MyeloSeq is performed at diagnosis (when it supports disease classification, treatment selection, and risk stratification) and can also be used for disease monitoring. MyeloSeq’s limit of detection (LOD) for identifying new variants is 2.0% variant allele fraction (VAF). In addition, MyeloSeq’s LOD for detecting previously identified variants is 0.1% VAF, which is sufficient for measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment.\n\n\nWorkflow\nMyeloSeq is currently run twice per week. Sequencing libraries are loaded on a NovaSeq X Plus on Tuesday and Friday, and data are (usually) available for analysis the following Friday and Monday, respectively. Case assignments for the following week are distributed via email by the fellow on service on Friday. Trainees review the sequencing data and template clinical reports for sign out by 1400 on Tuesday and Friday afternoons. Briefly, trainees are expected to:\n\nSummarize clinically relevant information in a concise history\nReview quality control metics and notify the fellow on service of any cases that don’t meet target thresholds\nEvaluate and classify individual variants\nProvide a brief clinical interpretation for the overall set of variants identified\nUpload case data to CoPath and format the clinical report\nNotify the fellow and/or attending on service of any questions or concerns related to the technical details of the data and/or the clinical interpretation of the case\n\n\n\nData\nTrainees will need read access to the Department of Pathology server, the web-based reporting too, and an active CoPath account to prepare cases. Please reach out to the fellow on service to arrange access if needed. Accessing these resources from off campus will require you to be on the medical school virtual private network (VPN).\nTo connect to the department server on a Windows computer, use the File Explorer application:\n\nRight click on This PC and select Map network drive...\nType \\\\pathfiles.wustl.edu\\AMP\\Genomics\\Myeloseq_Results into the Folder box and click Finish\n\nTo access data on a Mac, use the Finder application:\n\nSelect Go → Connect to Server from the menu bar (or press ⌘K)\nType smb://pathfiles.wustl.edu/AMP/Genomics/Myeloseq_Results into the Server Address box and click Connect\n\nCases are organized on the department server by batch. Each batch directory contains a separate folder for each case as well as a TSV file summarizing the quality control metrics for all cases (QC_metrics.tsv). Each case folder contains the following files:\n\n*annotated.vcf.gz: variant call format file of all variants detected by the analysis pipeline\n*annotated_filtered.vcf.gz: variant call format file of filtered variants\n*cram: alignment file\n*cram.crai: alignment index\n*report.json: case report text file\n*report.txt: case report json file\n\n\n\nQC Review\nThe first step in reviewing a case is to ensure that the sequencing data meet the validated quality thresholds. These data are included at the top of each *report.txt file along with reference ranges:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nReference Range\n\n\n\n\nMAPPING/ALIGNING SUMMARY: Total bases (Gb)\n&gt;20\n\n\nMAPPING/ALIGNING SUMMARY: Total input reads (M)\n&gt;150\n\n\nMAPPING/ALIGNING SUMMARY: Q30 bases R1 (%)\n&gt;90\n\n\nMAPPING/ALIGNING SUMMARY: Q30 bases R2 (%)\n&gt;85\n\n\nMAPPING/ALIGNING SUMMARY: Mismatched bases R1 (%)\n&lt;0.9\n\n\nMAPPING/ALIGNING SUMMARY: Mismatched bases R2 (%)\n&lt;0.9\n\n\nMAPPING/ALIGNING SUMMARY: Mapped reads (%)\n&gt;98\n\n\nMAPPING/ALIGNING SUMMARY: Insert length\n&gt;150\n\n\nCOVERAGE SUMMARY: Aligned reads in target region (%)\n&gt;45\n\n\nCOVERAGE SUMMARY: Target bases &gt;500x (%)\n&gt;98\n\n\nCCOVERAGE SUMMARY: Target bases &gt;2,500x (%)\n&gt;90\n\n\nCOVERAGE SUMMARY: Average alignment coverage over target region\n&gt;5,000\n\n\n\nThe most important metrics to evaluate are MAPPING/ALIGNING SUMMARY: Total bases (Gbp), COVERAGE SUMMARY: Average alignment coverage over target region, and COVERAGE SUMMARY: Target bases &gt;500x (%). For a new diagnosis, &gt;98% of the target space needs to achieve &gt;500x coverage. For a negative MRD case, mean coverage needs to be &gt;5,000x.\nCases that don’t meet the mean coverage and/or coverage breadth targets and also don’t have adequate total bases may benefit from additional sequencing of the existing library. Cases that don’t meet the mean coverage and/or coverage breadth targets and do have adequate total sequencing may indicate a failed library, requiring a new library to be prepared and/or an alternative specimen to be analyzed.\nIt is also important to review the haplotect summary for every case:\n*** Haplotect Contamination Estimate ***\n\ntotalSites      informativeSites        meanCoverage    contaminatingHaplotypeCount     totalReads      contaminationEstimate\n75      2       1881.24 4.0     7582    0.0011\nHaplotect is an algorithm that analyzes known polymorphic sites in the genome to quantitatively estimate sample contamination (i.e., evidence of the presence of DNA from more than one individual in the sequencing data). A contaminationEstimate &gt;0.02 (2%) is concerning for contamination. However, in patients who have received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, elevated Haplotect scores most likely represent mixed chimerism, which should be noted in the case interpretation.\n\n\nReporting Tool\nWe use a web-based reporting tool to help template clinical reports. Four tabs are available for each case: JSON, QC, Interpretation, Priors, and Classifier. Opening a case defaults to the QC tab for review. The Interpretation tab lists all detected variants with checkboxes to select which variants are included in the report and includes text boxes for the Clinical History and Variant Interpretation and a dropdown menu for Specimen Site.\n\n\nClinical History\nPlease provide a concise history summarizing clinically relevant patient information. Histories should not be copy-pasted from clinical notes and should not contain any undefined abbreviations. Key data to review are:\n\nRecent clinical notes to place the specimen in the appropriate clinical context and treatment timepoint (notes from the Bone Marrow Transplant service are often the most informative for this purpose)\nThe corresponding surgical pathology case\nThe corresponding cytogenetic studies\n\n“Corresponding” means from the same specimen (usually bone marrow biopsy), if applicable. You will also need to review prior MyeloSeq and cytogenetic studies to determine which variants are being followed in patients who are being monitored. In addition, it can be helpful to check for measurable residual disease testing performed by flow cytometry and/or the results of STR identity testing in patients who have received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants, but these data generally do not need to be included in the history unless there are specific points of confusion they address.\nIn general, the following structure is appropriate for most cases:\n(##)-year-old (man|woman) with a history of (myeloid neoplasm (diagnosed YYYY-MM-DD) with [a normal karyotype|a complex karyotype|{short list of cytogenetic abnormalities}] [and varaints in {gene list}]), who (is currently being treated and|is status post hematopoietic cell transplant (YYYY-MM-DD) and) (presents for evaluation|presents for treatment|presents for follow up|is admitted for [indication]). Corresponding bone marrow biopsy (S##-####) shows (top-line diagnosis). Corresponding cytogenetic studies (G##-####) show ({list of FISH findings}|karyotype|no evidence of clonal aberrations). Corresponding ChromoSeq study (W##-###) (did not identify any copy number alterations, structural variants, or gene variants|showed {list of variants}).\n\n\nVariant Review\nWithin the reporting tool, variants are organized into the following sections:\n\nReportable Mutations: new variants detected at a VAF &gt;2% or prior variants detected at a VAF &gt;0.1%\nPrior Mutations Not Detected in This Case: prior variants not detected at &gt;0.1% VAF\nLow-Level Somatic Mutations: variants that passed the quality thresholds defined by the analysis pipeline but that were present below the validated VAF thresholds\nFiltered Variants (Report with Caution): variants that failed quality thresholds defined by the analysis pipeline; these should almost never be reported\nTier 4 Polymorphisms: variants that passed the quality thresholds defined by the analysis pipeline and that have been reported at &gt;0.1% of individuals in population databases\n\nIn general, the default set of variants selected for reporting is correct. However, linking to historical cases is based on patient identifier lists that are not always complete, meaning sometimes the set of previously detected variants is missing or incomplete. Please confirm that previously reported variants (based on your review of prior MyeloSeq cases) appear in either the Reportable Mutations or Prior Mutations Not Detected in This Case tables. In some cases, missing variants can be recovered from the Low-Level Somatic Mutations table. Other times, this requires additional investigation. Please let the fellow on service know if you encounter a case that does not appear to be correctly linked to previous studies.\nIf you have reason to believe that a particular variant is an artifact, you can remove it from the report by unchecking the Report or Report + previously detected box associated with each record.\nVariants that appear in Tier 4 Polymorphisms should almost never be included in the report. The exception to this guideline is if there is specific clinical concern for inherited cancer predisposition in a patient and a known pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant appears in this table. This most often occurs in relation to DDX41 variants. Patients with DDX41-mutated myeloid neoplams typically have one germline and one somatic DDX41 variant. Some pathogenic germline DDX41 variants have been seen in the population at &gt;0.1% minor allele frequency and, therefore, may appear in the Tier 4 Polymorphisms table.\n\n\nVariant Classification\nThe current version of the reporting tool classifies individual variants as pathogenic or of uncertain significance based on whether they have been reported by one of several high-quality sequencing studies involving large cohorts of patients with myeloid neoplasms. We have modified this classification for our clinical reports, but this action is not yet automated within the reporting tool. Therefore, variant classifications have to be manually updated after exporting the data from the reporting tool. Please ask the fellows for a current version of the variant classification standard operating procedure for details regarding the variant classification rules. Briefly, variants should be classified as one of:\n\nPotentially therapeutic: variant associated with an FDA-approved targeted therapy (FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, IDH1 p.R132, IDH2 p.R140, and IDH2 p.R172)\nPathogenic: not potentially therapeutic and previously reported by high-quality sequencing studies of patients with myeloid neoplasms or a recurrent class of variants in patients with myeloid neoplasms as defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines\nPossibly donor-derived: not potentially therapeutic or pathogenic, found at a VAF of 35%–65% in a patient after hematopoietic cell transplantation\nPossibly germline: not potentially therapeutic or pathogenic, found at a VAF of 35%–65% in a patient with no history of hematopoietic cell transplantation\nUncertain: all other variants\n\n\n\nCase Interpretation\nThe goal of the case interpretation is to summarize the clinical significance of the overall set of variants observed in the case with an emphasis on their collective implications for diagnosis, treatment, and risk stratification.\nFor new diagnoses of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, this should include the disease classification according to the International Consensus Classification (ICC) critera as well as the 5th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumours (WHO-HAEM5), when possible. In addition, an overall risk stratification consistent with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines should be provided for new diagnoses.\nExamples:\n\nVariants in PTPN11, RUNX1, and U2AF1 are identified. This case is best classified as acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related gene mutations by International Consensus Classification (ICC) criteria or acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia-related based on the 5th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumours (WHO-HAEM5). The overall constellation of variants is consistent with poor/adverse-risk acute myeloid leukemia by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.\nA TP53 c.713G&gt;A (p.C238Y) variant is identified. This case is best classified as myelodysplastic syndrome with mutated TP53 by International Consensus Classification (ICC) criteria or myelodysplastic neoplasm with biallelic TP53 inactivation based on the 5th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Hematolymphoid Tumors (WHO-HAEM5). The overall constellation of variants is consistent with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nFor patients who have an existing diagnosis and are being monitored, the interpretation usually consists entirely of an assessment of MRD status, i.e., MRD positive or MRD negative.\nExamples:\n\nPreviously identified variants in FLT3 and IDH1 are again seen, consistent with persistent molecular disease (measurable residual disease [MRD] positive). There is evidence of significant chimerism.\nPreviously identified variants in ASXL1, DNMT3A, and TP53 are not seen, consistent with mutation clearance and measurable residual disease (MRD) negative status at a sensitivity of at least 0.1% VAF. Overall quality control metrics are within normal limits. There is no evidence of significant chimerism.\nPreviously identified variants in CEBPA, FLT3, NPM1, and WT1 are not seen, consistent with mutation clearance and measurable residual disease (MRD) negative status at a sensitivity of at least 0.1% VAF. Overall quality control metrics are within normal limits. We note that a TET2 c.3409+1G&gt;T variant is again seen at a reduced variant allele fraction compared to this patient’s prior study. Persistent TET2 variants after treatment are not associated with an increased risk of relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 29601269).\n\nFor patients who have received an allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transpant, we generally report haplotect contamination estimates of 2%–5% as evidence low-level chimerism and estimates &gt;5% as evidence of significant chimerism.\nMyeloSeq is also ordered on peripheral blood specimens for patients with chronic unexplained cytopenias, particularly in the outpatient setting. Detecting variants in these patients demonstrates they have clonal hematopoiesis, but it is generally not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of a speicifc myeloid neoplasm, which usually requires a bone marrow biopsy.\nExamples:\n\nVariants in BCOR and DNMT3A are identified, consistent with clonal hematopoiesis. Loss-of-function variants in BCOR and DNMT3A are seen recurrently in patients with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP/ARCH) as well as myeloid neoplasms. A bone marrow biopsy may be considered for further evaluation if clinically indicated.\nNo variants are identified. Overall quality control metrics are within normal limits. The absence of a variant detectable with this assay does not exude a diagnosis of a myeloid neoplasm.\n\n\n\nUploading Cases to CoPath\nOnce the final set of reportable variants have been selected and the Variant Interpretation, Clinical History, and Specimen Site have all been entered, clicking Generate and download RTF saves a formatted version of the report as an rtf document to your default downloads location. Note that some default applications for view *.rtf files disrupts the structure of the tables. Please open the *.rtf files with Microsoft Word to display them correctly. The report includes blue headers corresponding to the structured sections of the CoPath report: Interpretation, Diagnosis, Results-Commments. To upload the data to CoPath:\n\nOpen the corresponding case in CoPath (select Procedure Entry/Addendum Entry/Edit).\nEnter the name of the attending assigned to the case as well as your own under Procedure Pathologist(s).\nClick Edit Text, which opens a CoPath instance of Microsoft Word. Always confirm that the case accession at the top of the CoPath window exactly matches the case accession in the *.rtf document.\nCopy and paste the data (excluding the headers) into each section of the CoPath Word document. Note that by default, text is pasted into CoPath without formatting. Use control-alt-V on a PC or option-control-command-V on a Mac to preserve the text formatting when pasting the data in CoPath. Also, note that the table widths are not cleanly formatted by default. Please extend the right border of the table so that it occupies the full width of the page and arrange the columns so that the content is clean and easy to read.\nOnce you’ve finished editing the report, click the pink box in the upper left corner to exit the CoPath Word application.\nClick Save/Next Specimen\nIf the case is ready to be reviewed by the attending, place it in his/her queue by selecting Complete/Send to Pathologist; otherwise, if you are still working on the case, select No Action.\nUnder “Do you want to save changes to specimen W##-####?” click Yes to save your changes; your work is not saved until you click Yes.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBackground\n\nDuncavage EJ et al.

    "text": "Interpretation\nCase interpretations are provided in the Comment field and should be tailored to the specific variants identified, patient history, and associated clinical data. The goal is to clearly and concisely describe key results, comment on consistencies/discrepancies with orthogonal molecular and cytogenetic testing, and provide a comprehensive summary of how the results impact the patient’s diagnosis and overall risk stratification, if appropriate.\nThe following statements (in order) may be useful for templating comments in some cases but will require modification for accuracy, clarity, and readability. Note that the interpretive comments included in cytogenetic reports provide excellent examples for how to appropriately describe the cytogenetic alterations enumerated by International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) karyotypes.\n\n(No copy number alterations | A [deletion | duplication] of the [long | short] arm of chromosome [chr] | No copy number alterations) (was | were) identified, consistent with (a complex karyotype and) the corresponding cytogenetic studies (G22-####).\n(In addition, a [translocation | inversion | interchromosomal rearrangement | intrachromosomal rearrangement] involving the [(short | long) arm of chromosome (chr) and the (short | long) arm of chromosome (chr)] was identified.)\n([A mutation in (gene) | Mutations in (genes)] [was | were] also detected, consistent with the corresponding MyeloSeq study (W22-####).)\n(We note that [a mutation in (gene) | mutations in (genes)] detected by MyeloSeq at [a VAF | VAFs] below 10% [was | were] not identified by ChromoSeq, although this is below the limit of detection of this assay.)\n(Given the patient history and associated clinical data, this case is best classified as [classification] by International Consensus Classification (ICC) criteria.)\n(The overall constellation of mutations is consistent with [risk group] molecular risk per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.)\n\n\nReferences\n\nArber DA et al.

    "section": "Reporting Tool",
    "text": "Reporting Tool\nThe GatewayReporter tool is a web-based JavaScript application used to prepare GatewaySeq clinical reports. This tool reads data from the .json files associated with each case. The landing page (Orders tab) presents a dashboard of pending and completed cases (completed cases can be viewed by de-selecting Hide Final orders). Clicking on an individual orderid in this table allows you to enter and review and/or edit a specific case. You can then work through all of the components of the case by moving left to right across the tabs in the reporting tool (Case, QC, Variants, CNV, Fusions, TMB/MSI, Interpretation, PDF, and JSON).\n\nCase\nPatient Information\n\nThe patient Name, Date Of Birth, Sex, MRN, and CoPath Accession Number are populated directly from Copath; verify these for accuracy\nOrdering Physician: the attending physician on the associated Epic order or the ordering pathologist for orders placed by pathology (Epic requisitions and/or histology orders are scanned into the Image Gallery in CoPath)\n\nSpecimen Information\n\nTumor Origin: select from dropdown\nSpecimen Site, Corresponding Specimen Number, and Specimen Collected Date: enter based on corresponding surgical or cytology case\nBlock number: enter from histology order\nTumor cellularity: enter from histology order; if not listed, ask the Molecular Coordinators to pull the case to assess tumor cellularity\n\nDiagnostic Information\n\nStated Diagnosis: enter from corresponding surgical or cytology case\nDiagnostic Timepoint, Histologic Grade, T stage, N stage, M stage, and AJCC/FIGO Stage Group: select from dropdown based on corresponding surgical or cytology case; if information is not known, select NA\n\n\n\nQC\nCases with any of QC metrics outside of the reference range may require additional sequencing, preparation of new sequencing libraries, or submission of alternative specimens. Any cases that do not meet QC metrics should be brought to the attention of the sign out pathologist as soon as possible. In certain cases (e.g. no additional material), the pathologist may choose to sign out cases that do not meet QC metrics as exceptions and issue a limited report (SNVs and indels only).\n\nMapping/Aligning Summary: sequencing yield, read quality, alignment rate, and insert size\nCoverage Summary: on-target rate, on-target coverage\nUMI Summary: percentage of duplicate reads (reflects complexity of input material/number of distinct input molecules)\nFailed Exon QC: small variant target regions that did not have adequate mean coverage or an adequate proportion of target bases covered at &gt;100x or &gt;250x\nGene Coverage QC: mean coverage, proportion of target bases covered at &gt;100x, and proportion of target bases covered at &gt;250x for every gene on the panel\nFusion Coverage QC: fusion target regions that did not have adequate mean coverage or an adequate proportion of target bases covered at &gt;100x or &gt;250x\nMSI/Haplotect coverage QC: MSI and haplotect target regions that did not have adequate mean coverage or an adequate proportion of target bases covered at &gt;100x or &gt;250x\nHaplotect summary: haplotect is an algorithm that analyzes known polymorphic sites in the genome to quantitatively estimate sample contamination (i.e., evidence of the presence of DNA from more than one individual in the sequencing data); if the contamination estimate is greater than 0.04 with &gt;1 informative site, there is evidence of potential contamination, which must be accounted for during the interpretation, and/or a new specimen or new library may be needed\n\n\n\nVariants\nVariant classification and interpretation are based on the AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines for reporting sequence variants in cancer (PMID: 27993330). Tier 1 and 2 variants are classified as Significant and Tier 3 variants are classified as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS). Tier 4 variants are not reported.\nVariants that pass all internal QC filters are listed in the PASS table. Variants in genes with potential clinical significance for each tumor type (based on the data entered on the Case tab) are classified as Significant by default. Review these classifications to ensure that variants classified as Significant meet criteria for Tier 1 or 2 variants and that variants classified as VUS do not (use the checkboxes to update the Diagnostic, Prognostic, Therapeutic, and Oncogenic/Likely Oncogenic classifications as needed). Note that our internal reporting policy is to classify Oncogenic/Likely Oncogenic variants as Tier 2. Additional information for each variant, including links to external databases, can be viewed by clicking on the ⋁ symbol. The majority of Tier 4 variants are automatically filtered from the report based on their frequency in the general population (filtering frequency &gt;0.1%); however, the annotation and comparison of multinucleotide variants to population databases in particular is error-prone and should be double-checked to ensure that Tier 4 variants aren’t mistakenly reported as VUS.\nVariants that are below the validated LOD (5% VAF) or that fail other quality filters are listed in the Filtered table. Variants included here should rarely be reported. The primary exceptions are 1) variants that represent a nucleotide change that is identical to a variant that was previously reported in the same patient by orthogonal testing and whose only Filter flag is LowReads, and 2) variants with strong clinical significance that are just below the LOD and whose only Filter flag is LowReads (e.g., an EGFR exon 21 variant at a VAF of 4.8% in a lung cancer specimen with low tumor cellularity).\n\n\nCNV\nCopy number variants (CNVs) with copy ratios ≥2.0 (gain) or ≤0.5 (loss) are reported. Occasionally, CNVs will be listed in the Filtered table with a high/low copy ratio but whose only filter is cnvLength; these should usually be promoted to significant and included in the report.\n\n\nFusions\nFusions in the PASS table should usually be reported. Fusions listed in the Filtered table should be manually reviewed by BLATing the contig to ensure it represents a clean junction between two segments of high-quality sequence with high-quality alignments. Filtered fusion calls with only single read support (NoPairedReads flag and PR_READS=0 in the Info field) are usually artifacts.\n\n\nTMB/MSI\nNon-synonymous TMB (mutations/Mb) is reported with a categorization: low (0–10 mutations/Mb), intermediate (11–20 mutations/Mb), and high (&gt;20 mutations/Mb).\nCases with PercentageUnstableSites &lt;20 are classified as microsatellite stable (MSS) and cases with PercentageUnstableSites ≥20 are classified as microsatellite instability high (MSI-H). If ResultIsValid is false, there is a technical problem with the MSI analysis and the sign out pathologist should be notified.\n\n\nInterpretation\nStandardized comments and interpretations can be found in the Box folder under GWSeq Trainee Resources/interpretation/interpretations.docx.\nClinically Significant Genes with No Detected Variants\nThis section is automatically generated based on the tumor type and the variants selected as significant.\nInterpretation for Clinically Significant Variants\nEach variant that was selected as Significant in the Variants tab will appear here. At least one of the four significance categories should be selected (Diagnostic, Prognostic, Therapeutic, and/or Oncogenic/Likely Oncogenic).\nThe reporting tool includes disease-specific interpretations from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s precision oncology knowledge base, OncoKB, for each variant. Use the dropdowns to expand the tree under the OncoKB column and select the appropriate disease and click on the green text to pull comments into the Interpretation field. The comments entered for geneSummary, variantSummary, and tumorTypeSummary should generally be included in the interpretation and revised as needed. Please italicize all gene names by placing them inside asterisks (e.g., *EGFR*). Regarding variants with potential therapeutic significance, our current policy is to include FDA-approved and/or NCCN-compendium listed treatments (i.e., not investigational agents) in the written interpretation. If there is an approved treatment for a variant but for a different tumor type, these are considered Tier 2 by AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines, and a comment should be included in the variant-specific interpretation field. However, our policy is NOT to check Therapeutic for these variants or comment on the association in the Overall Interpretation field.\nThe OncoKB annotations typically provide high quality information for recurrent variants/variant types in key genes, but additional investigation is needed to interpret less well-characterized variants. The following resources may be helpful in those cases: Pubmed, Franklin, COSMIC, and CIViC.\nInterpretation for CNAs and Gene Fusions\nSimilar to the interpretations for individual small variants, interpretations for CNAs or Fusions included in the report should be entered here. These fields are not prepopulated with OncoKB annotations; however, the OncoKB web portal provides information for many of the recurrent CNAs and Fusions that are detected by GatewaySeq and may be a helpful resource when collecting data about these variants.\nOverall interpretation\nProvide a brief (2–3 sentence) summary of the entire case. The goal of the overall interpretation is to summarize the clinical significance of variants observed with an emphasis on implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. In particular, variants associated with FDA-approved or NCCN-recommended treatments, including TMB-H, should be stated here. Relevant negatives can also be included here, especially when the provider has indicated they are interested in the presence or absence of specific variants.\nFor cases with no variants that provide diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic information, we generally provide the following comment:\nNo variants associated with FDA-approved or NCCN compendium-listed treatments for patients with [tumor type] are identified. Overall quality control metrics are within normal limits.\n\n\nPDF\nAfter the QC review is complete and the case data and variant interpretations have been entered, selecting the PDF tab renders a preview of the final PDF report. Proofread this draft carefully; it is identical to the report that will appear in CoPath and Epic. Return to relevant tabs to make any necessary edits, and then return to the PDF tab to review any changes and save your work.\nDo not click Save JSON + ProcessPdf. This should only be clicked by the sign out pathologist. Clicking on this button finalizes the case and sends it to CoPath, preventing further changes without issuing an amended report.\nYou must click Save JSON to save your work (across all tabs). After clicking this, the next time the case is loaded from the Orders tab, the case will load with the updated information."
