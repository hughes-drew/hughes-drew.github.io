::: {style="text-align: justify"}
I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pathology & Immunology at [Washington University School of Medicine](https://pathology.wustl.edu/people/drew-hughes-md-phd/). My clinical responsibilities include sign out of next-generation sequencing assays for both solid and liquid tumors:

-   [ChromoSeq](https://pathologyservices.wustl.edu/services-tests/chromoseq/)
-   [GatewaySeq](https://pathologyservices.wustl.edu/items/gatewayseq-ngs-panel-with-interpretation/)
-   [MyeloSeq](https://pathologyservices.wustl.edu/items/myeloseq/)

My research interests include technology development to support clinical next-generation sequencing, including applications of machine learning to genomic data, bioinformatic method development, and liquid biopsy.
